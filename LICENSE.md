## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm a clinician working for a pharma company. Can I use this?

**A:** Yes! Under the Patient Care Use exception. Just notify us within 30 days and provide annual outcome reports. No fees.

### Q: I'm a researcher at a university receiving pharma funding. Can I use this?

**A:** Yes! Academic freedom is fully protected. Researchers have unrestricted access regardless of funding source.

### Q: Can a hospital that receives pharma grant money use this?

**A:** Yes! Healthcare providers have full unrestricted access regardless of funding sources. The restriction applies to pharmaceutical companies' own internal use, not to organizations they support.

### Q: What if my clinic has a pharma company on our advisory board?

**A:** You still have full unrestricted access. The restriction targets pharma companies' commercial operations, not clinical care settings.

### Q: Can I publish research using this tool?

**A:** Yes! Publish freely. Just cite appropriately. No permission needed.

### Q: What if I'm unsure whether I need permission?

**A:** Email us: acdemidont@nyxdynamics.org. We'll respond within 5 business days with clarification. We're friendly and want to help!

### Q: Will you grant permission to pharmaceutical companies?

**A:** We evaluate requests fairly, prioritizing public health impact. We're open to partnerships involving data sharing, validation studies, and health equity initiatives. We will not unreasonably withhold permission for uses that advance implementation science and patient care.

### Q: Why this license structure?

**A:** To maximize patient access (free for all healthcare) while ensuring pharmaceutical companies—who profit substantially from HIV prevention products this tool helps implement—contribute fairly when using academic work for commercial purposes. It balances open science with fair value exchange.
