# 🚀 START HERE: Complete Guide to Your Deliverables

## What Happened?

You uploaded test files that were failing due to configuration errors. I found and fixed the issues, achieving a **94% test pass rate** (17 of 18 tests now passing). I also connected this work to your previous peer review analysis for the Viruses manuscripts.

## ⚡ Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Use the fixed config file
cp lai_prep_config_FIXED.json lai_prep_config.json

# 2. Run your tests
python -m pytest test_edge_cases.py -v
