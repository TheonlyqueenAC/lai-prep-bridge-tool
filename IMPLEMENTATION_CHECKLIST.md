# LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Management
## Implementation Checklist for Clinics

---

## PURPOSE
This checklist helps your clinic systematically implement evidence-based strategies to improve LAI-PrEP initiation rates from the national average of 53% to target of 70%+.

---

## PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Week 1)
### Goal: Establish foundation and capture easy wins

### ☐ 1.1 Identify Oral PrEP Patients (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why**: 85-90% success rate vs. 53% for new patients

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Pull list of all current oral PrEP patients from EHR
- [ ] Review last HIV test date for each patient
- [ ] Prioritize patients with HIV test within last 3 months
- [ ] Create tracking spreadsheet: Name | Last Test | Contact Date | Outcome

**Script for Staff**:
> "We now offer long-acting injectable PrEP that only requires appointments every 2-6 months instead of daily pills. Would you be interested in learning more?"

**Success Metric**: Contact 100% of oral PrEP patients within 2 weeks

---

### ☐ 1.2 Designate Bridge Period Champion
**Why**: Someone needs to own the bridge period process

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Identify staff member (nurse, pharmacist, MA, social worker)
- [ ] Allocate protected time (start with 4-8 hours/week)
- [ ] Define responsibilities:
  - Track prescriptions → injections
  - Follow up on missed appointments
  - Coordinate HIV testing
  - Troubleshoot barriers
- [ ] Set up weekly check-in meeting

**Start Small**: Begin with just tracking - don't need full navigation program yet

---

### ☐ 1.3 Establish Same-Day Switching Protocol
**Why**: Eliminates bridge period for oral PrEP patients with recent tests

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Create protocol document:
  - If oral PrEP + HIV test <7 days → Can inject same day
  - If oral PrEP + HIV test 7-30 days → Order test, inject within week
  - If oral PrEP + HIV test >30 days → Order test, may need wait
- [ ] Train clinical staff on protocol
- [ ] Add standing order for LAI-PrEP in EHR
- [ ] Create patient handout explaining process

**Script for Providers**:
> "Since you're already on PrEP and had a negative HIV test [X days ago], we can give you your first injection [today/this week]. No need to wait!"

---

### ☐ 1.4 Set Up Basic Tracking
**Why**: Can't improve what you don't measure

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Create simple tracking spreadsheet:
  - Date prescribed
  - Population (MSM, women, adolescent, PWID, other)
  - Current PrEP status (oral, discontinued, naive)
  - Barriers identified
  - Date of first injection (or reason for non-initiation)
  - Days from prescription to injection
- [ ] Assign staff to enter data weekly
- [ ] Set goal: Track every LAI-PrEP prescription

**Metrics to Watch**:
- Initiation rate (target: >70%)
- Bridge duration (target: <14 days oral, <28 days new)
- Attrition reasons (identify patterns)

---

## PHASE 2: CORE INFRASTRUCTURE (Weeks 2-4)
### Goal: Build systems to support bridge period navigation

### ☐ 2.1 Implement Text Message Reminder System
**Why**: +5% improvement, low cost, high reach

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Choose platform (EHR module, standalone SMS service, or manual)
- [ ] Obtain patient consent for text messages
- [ ] Create message templates:
  - "Your HIV test appointment is in 2 days at [location]"
  - "Your LAI-PrEP injection is scheduled for [date/time]"
  - "Haven't heard from you - can we help reschedule?"
- [ ] Set up automated delivery (48h and 24h before appointments)
- [ ] Include callback number

**Sample Messages**:
> "Hi [Name], your HIV test for PrEP is tomorrow at 2pm. Reply CONFIRM if you're coming or HELP if you need to reschedule."

---

### ☐ 2.2 Accelerate HIV Testing Turnaround
**Why**: Every extra day increases attrition risk

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Negotiate with lab for expedited LAI-PrEP testing (24-48h goal)
- [ ] Consider point-of-care testing for same-day results
- [ ] Add HIV-1 RNA testing for all LAI-PrEP initiations (not just high-risk)
- [ ] Create "stat" order set in EHR for LAI-PrEP testing
- [ ] Train staff to flag LAI-PrEP tests as urgent

**Cost Consideration**: RNA testing adds cost but WHO recommends for LAI-PrEP due to long-acting consequences

---

### ☐ 2.3 Streamline Insurance Authorization
**Why**: Insurance delays are major cause of attrition

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Identify staff to "own" LAI-PrEP authorizations
- [ ] Create insurance authorization toolkit:
  - List of codes and required documentation
  - Template letters for appeals
  - Contact info for major insurers
  - Patient assistance program information
- [ ] Submit authorizations SAME DAY as prescription
- [ ] Follow up on pending authorizations every 3 days
- [ ] Track authorization timeline by insurer

**Pro Tip**: Submit authorization before HIV test results - can always cancel if test positive

---

### ☐ 2.4 Establish Transportation Support Program
**Why**: Transportation barrier = +10% attrition risk

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Budget for transportation support ($50-100/patient/initiation)
- [ ] Choose mechanism:
  - [ ] Uber/Lyft health partnership
  - [ ] Public transit vouchers/passes
  - [ ] Mileage reimbursement
  - [ ] Volunteer driver program
- [ ] Create simple request process
- [ ] Track utilization and outcomes

**Start Small**: Even 10 transportation vouchers can help your highest-risk patients

---

## PHASE 3: EXPANDED SERVICES (Months 2-3)
### Goal: Address population-specific barriers

### ☐ 3.1 Develop Patient Navigation Program
**Why**: +15% improvement for high-risk patients

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Hire/assign patient navigator (0.5-1.0 FTE)
- [ ] Define navigator role:
  - Contact patient within 24h of prescription
  - Identify individual barriers
  - Arrange transportation and childcare
  - Schedule and confirm appointments
  - Provide culturally concordant support
  - Troubleshoot problems in real-time
- [ ] Train navigator on:
  - LAI-PrEP basics
  - Motivational interviewing
  - Harm reduction principles
  - Cultural humility
- [ ] Set caseload goal: 100-150 active patients

**Navigator Workflow**:
1. Receive prescription notification from provider
2. Call patient within 24 hours
3. Conduct barrier assessment
4. Create individualized plan
5. Weekly contact until first injection
6. Hand off to retention navigator after initiation

---

### ☐ 3.2 Create Childcare Support System
**Why**: Essential for women with children

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Assess need (survey patients about childcare barriers)
- [ ] Choose approach:
  - [ ] On-site childcare area with staff/volunteer
  - [ ] Childcare vouchers for outside services
  - [ ] Home-based services (mobile unit)
- [ ] Budget: $20-50 per visit
- [ ] Advertise to patients
- [ ] Track impact on initiation

**Alternative**: Flexible scheduling (evenings/weekends) when partners available for childcare

---

### ☐ 3.3 Implement Adolescent-Specific Protocols
**Why**: 60-70% attrition risk without tailored approach

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Train staff on adolescent development and health autonomy
- [ ] Address privacy concerns:
  - Understand state laws on minor consent for PrEP
  - Create confidential communication plan
  - Manage insurance EOB issues
- [ ] Simplify scheduling:
  - Group appointments (test + injection same day if possible)
  - School-friendly hours
  - Text-based appointment management
- [ ] Provide transportation:
  - Partner with school-based health centers
  - Ride vouchers without parental notification
  - Public transit passes

**Legal Note**: Check your state's minor consent laws for HIV prevention services

---

### ☐ 3.4 Establish PWID-Specific Pathway
**Why**: 70-80% attrition with traditional clinic approach

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Partner with local syringe service program (SSP)
- [ ] Create low-barrier protocol:
  - No ID required (use nickname/DOB)
  - No abstinence requirement
  - Abbreviated intake forms
  - Flexible scheduling
  - No penalties for missed appointments
- [ ] Options:
  - [ ] Embed staff at SSP site
  - [ ] Bring mobile unit to SSP
  - [ ] Refer to specialized clinic with harm reduction principles
- [ ] Recruit peer navigators with lived PWID experience
- [ ] Provide bundled services (HCV, wound care, naloxone + LAI-PrEP)

**Critical**: Traditional clinic will fail for most PWID - need harm reduction approach

---

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION (Months 3-6)
### Goal: Refine and scale successful strategies

### ☐ 4.1 Analyze Your Data
**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Calculate current metrics:
  - Overall initiation rate: ____%
  - Oral-to-injectable rate: ____%
  - By population:
    - MSM: ____%
    - Women: ____%
    - Adolescents: ____%
    - PWID: ____%
  - Average bridge duration: ____ days
- [ ] Identify your biggest gaps
- [ ] Compare to benchmarks:
  - Overall: 70% target
  - Oral-to-injectable: 85% target
  - Bridge duration: <14 days (oral), <28 days (new)

---

### ☐ 4.2 Implement Peer Navigation for Key Populations
**Why**: +12% improvement, especially effective for PWID and transgender individuals

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Recruit peer navigators:
  - People with lived experience on LAI-PrEP
  - Members of affected communities
  - People in recovery (for PWID populations)
- [ ] Provide training:
  - Boundaries and professionalism
  - Privacy/confidentiality
  - Crisis response
  - When to escalate to clinical staff
- [ ] Compensation: Consider stipends or employment
- [ ] Supervision: Regular check-ins with clinical staff

**Populations Benefiting Most from Peer Navigation**:
- PWID (essential)
- Transgender individuals
- Adolescents/young adults
- Formerly incarcerated individuals

---

### ☐ 4.3 Expand Telehealth Integration
**Why**: +6% improvement, reduces visit burden

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Offer telehealth for:
  - Initial PrEP consultation
  - HIV test result delivery
  - Bridge period check-ins
  - Insurance troubleshooting
- [ ] Still require in-person for:
  - HIV testing (blood draw or rapid test)
  - First injection
- [ ] Technology support:
  - Provide phone numbers for patients without video
  - Simple platform (text link, no download)
  - Tech support staff to troubleshoot

**Hybrid Model**: Telehealth for education, in-person for clinical tasks

---

### ☐ 4.4 Establish Community Partnerships
**Why**: Brings services to where patients are

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Identify partner organizations:
  - [ ] Syringe service programs
  - [ ] LGBTQ community centers
  - [ ] Faith-based organizations
  - [ ] School-based health centers
  - [ ] Mobile health units

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "We're not seeing improvement in initiation rates"
Check:
- Are you actually identifying and addressing barriers? (not just prescribing)
- Is your navigator contacting patients within 24 hours?
- Are insurance authorizations submitted immediately?
- Are you prioritizing oral PrEP transitions?
- Are you measuring the right things?

### "We can't afford a navigator"
Options:
- Start with 0.25 FTE (10 hours/week)
- Reallocate existing staff time
- Apply for grants/funding
- Calculate cost offset (LAI-PrEP retention > oral PrEP retention)
- Partner with health department or university

### "Our PWID initiation rate is still very low"
This is expected with traditional clinic model:
- You MUST partner with harm reduction services
- Traditional clinic approach will not work
- Consider mobile delivery to SSP sites
- Peer navigation is essential

### "Insurance delays are killing us"
- Submit authorization day of prescription (before test results)
- Create expedited pathway with major insurers
- Document delays and advocate for policy change
- Patient assistance programs as backup
- Consider self-pay with reimbursement
