## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when pushing

**Solution:** Use Personal Access Token, not password
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR-TOKEN@github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repo.git
```

### "Repository not found"

**Solution:** Check repository URL is correct
```bash
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CORRECT-REPO-NAME.git
```

### Large file warning

**Solution:** Files over 50MB need Git LFS. Your files are all under 5MB, so this shouldn't be an issue.

### Merge conflicts

**Solution:** If you initialized with README on GitHub:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

## 📝 Alternative: If You Need to Start Over

If something goes wrong:

```bash
cd /mnt/user-data/outputs
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: UNAIDS Global Scale Validation"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/lai-prep-decision-tool.git
git push -u origin main
```
