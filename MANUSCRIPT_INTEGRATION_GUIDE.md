## Integration Checklist

### Before You Start:
- [ ] Backup your current manuscript file
- [ ] Have `MANUSCRIPT_REVISIONS.tex` open
- [ ] Note your current page/word count

### For Each Revision:
- [ ] Find the location in your manuscript
- [ ] Copy text from `MANUSCRIPT_REVISIONS.tex`
- [ ] Paste and verify formatting
- [ ] Update any cross-references
- [ ] Check that it compiles

### After Integration:

## Key Numbers to Update Throughout

**OLD â†’ NEW:**
- 13 interventions â†’ **21 interventions**
- "Validation across 4 tiers" â†’ **"Validation across 4 scales plus 18 unit tests"**

---

## Impact Assessment

### Manuscript Improvements:

**Validation Rigor:**
- Before: Progressive scale testing only
- After: Scale testing + comprehensive unit tests (100% pass)

**Evidence Base:**
- Before: 13 interventions
- After: 21 interventions with mechanism diversity

**Software Quality:**
- Before: Implicit
- After: Explicit architecture, testing, reproducibility

**Reproducibility:**
- Before: Code available
- After: Code + config + tests + JSON export

**Clinical Confidence:**
- Before: Scale validation
- After: Scale + edge cases + mechanism diversity

### Anticipated Reviewer Response:

âœ… **Stronger validation:** 18 unit tests addressing edge cases  
âœ… **More comprehensive:** 21 vs 13 interventions  
âœ… **Better architecture:** Configuration-driven design

## Time Estimates

**Quick integration** (essential updates only): 30-45 minutes
- Abstract, Methods 2.6, Conclusions

**Complete integration** (all revisions): 2-3 hours
- All 9 revision points
- Careful formatting and cross-reference checking

**With optional table**: +30 minutes
- Format and integrate intervention table

---

## Testing Your Revisions

After integration, verify:

1. **Manuscript compiles** without errors
2. **All cross-references** work (tables, figures, sections)
3. **Numbers are consistent** (21 interventions mentioned everywhere)
4. **Page count** is acceptable (if journal has limits)
5. **Flow is logical** (new sections integrate smoothly)

---

## Questions to Consider

**For Your Situation:**

1. **Page limits?** If tight, prioritize:
   - Abstract update
   - Methods 2.2.5 (unit testing)
   - Results 3.2.5 (test results)
   - Discussion update

2. **Supplementary materials?** Move optional intervention table there

3. **Emphasis preference?** 
   - More on testing â†’ expand Results 3.2.5
   - More on architecture â†’ expand Methods 2.1.4

---

## Support

**If you encounter issues:**

1. **Compilation errors:** Check LaTeX syntax in inserted sections
2. **Cross-references:** Update \ref{} tags for new tables
3. **Formatting:** Adjust table widths if needed
4. **Content questions:** All insertions are standalone, can skip if needed

---
