##  TOP 5 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1️⃣ REGIONAL HEALTH EQUITY GAP: 7.64 PERCENTAGE POINTS

```
Best:  Europe/Central Asia     29.33% ████████████████████████████████
Worst: Sub-Saharan Africa      21.69% ███████████████████████
                                      
                               Gap = 7.64 points (35% disparity)
```

**Sub-Saharan Africa** requires priority investment:

Moderate Risk   ██ 8.15% (1.73M)
Low Risk         0.00% (0)
```

**Critical Insight:** Default to intensive support model  
Only 8% of patients can succeed with minimal intervention.
