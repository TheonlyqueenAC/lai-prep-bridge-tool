# Your Guide to Starting Long-Acting Injectable PrEP
## What to Expect Between Your Prescription and First Injection

---

## What is Long-Acting Injectable PrEP?

Long-acting injectable PrEP is a medication that prevents HIV infection. Instead of taking a daily pill, you get an injection every **2 months** (cabotegravir) or **6 months** (lenacapavir).

**It works really well:**
- Over 96% effective at preventing HIV
- Once you start, 8 out of 10 people keep getting their injections
- Most people prefer injections over daily pills

## The "Bridge Period" - What You Need to Know

### What is it?

The "bridge period" is the time **between when your doctor prescribes the injection and when you actually get your first shot**. This usually takes **2-4 weeks**, but can be shorter if you're already on PrEP pills.

### Why can't I start today?

Unlike PrEP pills (which you can start the same day), the injection lasts for months in your body. We need to make absolutely sure you don't have HIV before giving you the injection. This requires:

1. ‚úì An HIV test
2. ‚úì Waiting for results
3. ‚úì Insurance approval (if needed)
4. ‚úì Scheduling your injection appointment

**Important**: During this waiting period, you are **not protected** from HIV yet. If you're at risk, talk to your doctor about using daily PrEP pills while you wait, or other prevention methods.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why is this taking so long?"

We know it's frustrating to wait. The injection lasts for months, so we must be 100% certain you don't have HIV. This is for your safety.

### "Can I start PrEP pills while I wait?"

**YES!** Ask your doctor. Many people take daily PrEP pills during the bridge period to stay protected, then switch to the injection when ready.

### "What if I miss an appointment?"

**Call us immediately!** We can reschedule. Missing one appointment doesn't mean you can't get the injection - we just need to get you back on track.

### "Will the injection hurt?"

Most people describe it as similar to a flu shot. The injection site might be sore for a few days. Your doctor will tell you how to manage any discomfort.

### "What happens after my first injection?"

You'll schedule your next injection (2 or 6 months away). After the first injection, it gets much easier - you just show up for your scheduled appointments!

### "What if I change my mind?"

That's okay! You can stop at any time. Just let your doctor know. If you're not sure, talk to your navigator - they can address your concerns.

## Why This Matters

HIV prevention is serious healthcare. Research shows that almost **half of people who are prescribed this injection never get their first shot**. Not because the medication doesn't work - it works great! But because of the challenges in the weeks between prescription and injection.

**That's why we're putting in this extra effort to help you succeed.**

The injection is highly effective and convenient once you start. We just need to get you through these first few weeks. With your participation and our support, you WILL get there!
