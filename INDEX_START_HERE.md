## ❓ Common Questions

### "Is this validated?"

The tool is based on published evidence from:
- >15,000 clinical trial participants (HPTN 083, 084, PURPOSE-1, PURPOSE-2)
- Real-world implementation data (53% initiation rate)
- Patient navigation literature (10-40% improvement in cancer care)
- Specific LAI-PrEP implementation studies

Population-specific projections are based on trial data and implementation science principles. The tool provides evidence-based estimates, not guarantees.

### "Do I need the Python code?"

**No!** The non-technical resources (especially NON_TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md and QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md) provide everything you need to apply the decision-making framework without any coding.

The Python code is provided for:
- Organizations wanting automated decision support
- Integration with electronic health records
- Research applications
- Customized dashboards

Most clinicians will never touch the code.

### "How long does this take to implement?"

**Minimal implementation**: 1-2 weeks
- Use QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md
- Assign bridge period champion
- Start tracking

**Full implementation**: 3-6 months
- Follow IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md
- Build navigation program
- Establish partnerships

**The tool itself**: <5 minutes per patient
- Risk assessment: 30 seconds
- Intervention selection: 2 minutes
- Documentation: 2 minutes

### "What if we don't have resources for navigation?"

Start small:
- Begin with just tracking (0 cost)
- Focus on oral PrEP transitions (easiest wins)
- Assign existing staff 0.25 FTE (10 hours/week)
- Apply for grants using IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md as template

Even minimal navigation (4-8 hours/week) improves outcomes significantly.

### "How do we convince leadership this matters?"

Use these talking points:
1. **Current failure rate**: 47% of prescriptions never result in injection
2. **Clinical impact**: LAI-PrEP >96% effective but only if people start
3. **Efficiency argument**: Better initiation = less retention support needed
4. **Equity imperative**: Vulnerable populations have highest attrition
5. **Return on investment**: Every dollar in navigation saves in retention costs

Show leadership the data in NON_TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md.

## 🎯 Success Story Example

**Example Clinic: "From 50% to 78% Initiation in 6 Months"**

**Baseline** (No intervention):
- 20 LAI-PrEP prescriptions

- 26 successfully transitioned (87%)
- Added navigation program
- 28 new prescriptions (PrEP-naive)
- 20 initiated (71%)
- **Overall: 46/58 = 78% initiation rate**

**What They Did**:
1. Week 1: Used QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md, identified oral PrEP patients
2. Month 1: Hired 0.5 FTE navigator
3. Month 2: Implemented text reminders
4. Month 3: Added transportation support
5. Month 4-6: Refined based on data

**Cost**: $35,000/year for navigation program
**Return**: 18 additional patients on highly effective prevention

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

The LAI-PrEP bridge period is a **solvable problem**. We know what works:
- Prioritize oral PrEP transitions (85-90% success)
- Use patient navigation for high-risk populations (+15% improvement)
- Remove structural barriers (transportation, childcare, insurance)
- Harm reduction approach for PWID (essential)
- Measure and improve continuously

**You don't need to implement everything at once.** Start with quick wins, measure your progress, and build incrementally.

**The goal**: Get more people successfully started on this highly effective prevention tool.

**The reality**: With proactive intervention, you CAN achieve >70% initiation rates.

**The impact**: Every patient who successfully initiates is a life potentially saved from HIV.

*This resource package was created to make LAI-PrEP implementation accessible to everyone - from front-line clinicians to healthcare administrators to policy makers. Use what works for you, adapt what doesn't, and please share your successes with others working on HIV prevention.*

**Good luck! You've got this!** 🎉
