### üíª Code Contributions

#### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with these specifics:

```python
# Use type hints
def assess_patient(patient: PatientProfile) -> Assessment:
    ...

# Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)

# Use descriptive variable names
bridge_success_probability = 0.53  # Good
bsp = 0.53  # Bad

# Add docstrings
def calculate_risk(patient: PatientProfile) -> float:
    """
    Calculate bridge period failure risk.
    
    Args:
        patient: Patient profile with demographics and barriers
        
    Returns:
        Risk score from 0.0 (low risk) to 1.0 (high risk)
        
    Example:
        >>> patient = PatientProfile(age=24, population=Population.MSM)
        >>> risk = calculate_risk(patient)
        >>> print(f"Risk: {risk:.2%}")
    """
    ...
```

#### Testing Requirements

All code contributions must include tests:

```python
# tests/test_patient_assessment.py
import pytest
from lai_prep_decision_tool import PatientProfile, assess_patient, Population

def test_high_risk_patient():
    """Test assessment of high-risk patient"""
    patient = PatientProfile(
        age=18,
        population=Population.ADOLESCENT,
        has_insurance=False,
        barriers=[
            Barrier.TRANSPORTATION,
            Barrier.HOUSING_INSTABILITY,
            Barrier.NO_IDENTIFICATION
        ]
    )
    
    assessment = assess_patient(patient)
    
    assert assessment.success_probability < 0.40
    assert len(assessment.recommended_interventions) >= 3
    assert Intervention.PATIENT_NAVIGATION in assessment.recommended_interventions
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
