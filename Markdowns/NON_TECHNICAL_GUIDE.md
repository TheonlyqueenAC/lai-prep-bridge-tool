# LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Decision Tool
## A Non-Technical Guide for Clinicians and Healthcare Workers

---

## What Is This Tool?

This is a **clinical decision support calculator** that helps you predict whether a patient will successfully complete the "bridge period" (the time between prescribing LAI-PrEP and administering the first injection).

Think of it like a **risk calculator** similar to cardiovascular risk scores (like Framingham) or fracture risk tools (like FRAX), but specifically designed for LAI-PrEP implementation.

### Why This Matters

Research shows that **only 53% of patients who are prescribed LAI-PrEP actually receive their first injection**. The other 47% are lost during the bridge period due to various barriers. This tool helps you:

1. **Predict** which patients are at high risk of never starting
2. **Identify** specific barriers preventing initiation
3. **Select** interventions proven to improve success rates
4. **Estimate** how much those interventions will help

## Understanding the Bridge Period

### What is the Bridge Period?

The **bridge period** is everything that happens between when you decide to prescribe LAI-PrEP and when the patient receives their first injection. This includes:

- Getting HIV test results back (must confirm HIV-negative)
- Scheduling the injection appointment
- Getting insurance authorization
- Patient arranging transportation
- Patient managing childcare (if needed)
- Waiting period for test results

**Duration**: Usually 2-8 weeks, depending on circumstances

### Why Does This Matter?

Unlike oral PrEP (where patients can start the same day they get their prescription), LAI-PrEP **cannot** be started immediately. This delay creates opportunities for patients to:
- Change their mind
- Face logistical barriers
- Lose motivation
- Get frustrated with the process
- Acquire HIV during the waiting period

**47% of patients never make it through this bridge period** - and the tool helps you prevent that.

---

## How Does the Tool Work?

### Step 1: Input Patient Information

The tool asks for basic information about your patient:

#### **Population Category**
Which group best describes your patient?
- Men who have sex with men (MSM)
- Cisgender women
- Transgender women
- Adolescents (ages 16-24)
- People who inject drugs (PWID)
- Pregnant or lactating individuals
- General population

**Why this matters**: Different populations face different barriers. For example, adolescents have a 60-70% risk of not completing the bridge period, while MSM have a 40-50% risk.

#### **Current PrEP Status**
- **Never been on PrEP** ("naive") - Highest risk
- **Currently taking oral PrEP** - Much lower risk (85-90% success!)
- **Previously on oral PrEP but stopped** - Moderate risk

**Why this matters**: Patients already on oral PrEP are your BEST candidates - they've already proven they can navigate the healthcare system and are motivated for prevention.

#### **Recent HIV Test?**
- Has the patient had an HIV test within the last 7 days?
- YES = Can potentially start same day or very soon
- NO = Will need testing, adding 2-3 weeks to bridge period

#### **Barriers Present**
Does your patient face any of these challenges?
- ☐ Transportation difficulties
- ☐ Childcare needs
- ☐ Housing instability
- ☐ Insurance authorization delays expected
- ☐ Scheduling conflicts (work, school)
- ☐ Medical mistrust
- ☐ Privacy/confidentiality concerns
- ☐ Past healthcare discrimination
- ☐ Competing health priorities
- ☐ Limited experience navigating healthcare
- ☐ Legal concerns (for PWID)
- ☐ No government ID
- ☐ Active substance use

**Check ALL that apply** - each barrier increases risk.

#### **Healthcare Setting**
Where will the patient receive care?
- Academic medical center
- Community health center
- Private practice
- Pharmacy
- Harm reduction/syringe service program
- LGBTQ community center
- Mobile clinic
- Telehealth-integrated

### Step 2: Tool Calculates Risk

The tool automatically calculates:

1. **Baseline Success Rate**: Starting point based on population (e.g., MSM = 55%)
2. **Adjusted Success Rate**: After accounting for individual barriers (may drop to 20% or lower with multiple barriers)
3. **Risk Level**: Low, Moderate, High, or Very High
4. **Estimated Bridge Duration**: How long from prescription to injection (0-56 days)

### Step 3: Tool Recommends Interventions

The tool provides a **prioritized list** of interventions, ranked by:
- **Priority Level**: Critical, High, or Moderate
- **Expected Improvement**: How many percentage points this intervention adds to success rate
- **Evidence Level**: Strong, Moderate, or Emerging

Example output:
```
1. Same-day switching protocol
   Priority: CRITICAL
   Expected Improvement: +40 percentage points
   Evidence: Strong
   
2. Patient navigation program
   Priority: High
   Expected Improvement: +15 percentage points
   Evidence: Strong
```

### Step 4: Tool Predicts Final Outcome

The tool estimates success rate **WITH** your top interventions implemented:
- Baseline: 20% → With interventions: 48% (+28 points)

This helps you understand if your interventions are sufficient or if more intensive support is needed.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Best Case Scenario

**Patient**: 28-year-old MSM currently on oral PrEP, had HIV test 3 days ago

**Tool Output**:
- Baseline Success: 55%
- With barriers: 50% (mild scheduling conflict)
- **Recommended Action**: Same-day switching protocol
- **Final Success Prediction**: 86%
- **Bridge Duration**: 0-3 days

**What This Means**: This patient is a PRIORITY for immediate transition. Don't make them wait! You can inject today or within a few days. This is your easiest case.

**Action Steps**:
1. Confirm HIV test is current (✓ - 3 days ago)
2. Schedule injection appointment for this week
3. Submit insurance authorization immediately
4. Done! Patient has 86% chance of success

---

### Example 2: Moderate Risk Case

**Patient**: 32-year-old cisgender woman who stopped oral PrEP 6 months ago, has transportation and childcare barriers

**Tool Output**:
- Baseline Success: 45%
- With barriers: 17% (very high risk!)
- **Recommended Actions**:
  1. Patient navigation program (+15 points)
  2. Transportation vouchers (+8 points)
  3. Childcare support (+8 points)
- **Final Success Prediction**: 45%
- **Bridge Duration**: 21-56 days

**What This Means**: Without help, this patient has only a 17% chance of starting LAI-PrEP. But with navigation, transportation, and childcare support, you can increase success to 45%.

**Action Steps**:
1. Assign patient navigator immediately
2. Provide Uber/Lyft vouchers for appointments
3. Offer on-site childcare or childcare vouchers
4. Navigator should call within 24 hours of prescription
5. Schedule HIV testing at most convenient location
6. Text reminders 48h and 24h before appointments

---

### Example 3: Very High Risk Case

**Patient**: 35-year-old person who injects drugs (PWID), experiencing housing instability, no ID, multiple barriers

**Tool Output**:
- Baseline Success: 25%
- With barriers: 5% (extremely high risk!)
- **Recommended Actions**:
  1. Harm reduction integration (SSP) (+15 points)
  2. Peer navigation (+15 points)
  3. Mobile delivery (+12 points)
  4. Accelerated testing (+10 points)
- **Final Success Prediction**: 31%
- **Bridge Duration**: 21-56 days

**What This Means**: Traditional clinic-based approach will fail. This patient needs services brought to them in a trusted setting with peer support.

**Action Steps**:
1. **DO NOT** refer to traditional clinic - will lose patient
2. Partner with local syringe service program (SSP)
3. Arrange mobile delivery to SSP site
4. Use rapid HIV testing (results same day)
5. Assign peer navigator with lived PWID experience
6. Low-barrier approach - NO abstinence requirement
7. Flexible scheduling - work around patient's life

## How to Read the Tool's Output

### Success Rate Numbers

**Understanding the Numbers**:
- **90-100%**: Excellent - patient very likely to initiate
- **70-89%**: Good - standard protocols should work
- **50-69%**: Moderate - navigation recommended
- **30-49%**: Concerning - multiple interventions needed
- **Below 30%**: Critical - intensive support required

### Risk Categories

**Low Risk** (< 40% attrition)
- Standard protocols appropriate
- Minimal additional support needed
- Follow routine procedures

**Moderate Risk** (40-55% attrition)
- Patient navigation recommended
- Address 1-2 key barriers
- Close follow-up

**High Risk** (55-70% attrition)
- Multiple interventions required
- Intensive navigation
- Proactive barrier removal

**Very High Risk** (> 70% attrition)
- System redesign needed
- Traditional approach will fail
- Consider alternative delivery model

### Intervention Priorities

**CRITICAL** = Must do this or patient will almost certainly not start
- Example: Same-day switching for oral PrEP patients
- Example: Harm reduction integration for PWID

**HIGH** = Strongly recommended, substantial impact
- Example: Patient navigation for adolescents
- Example: Transportation support when barrier present

**MODERATE** = Helpful but not essential
- Example: Text message reminders
- Example: Telehealth counseling

## Practical Application in Your Clinic

### Using the Tool in Clinical Workflow

#### **During the PrEP Consultation**

1. **Before prescribing**, mentally assess:
   - Is patient on oral PrEP now? → If YES, prioritize for rapid transition
   - What barriers do I see? → Transportation? Childcare? Housing?
   - What's their risk category? → Adolescent PWID = very high risk

2. **Use the tool** (or reference the summary tables in this guide)

3. **Don't just prescribe and hope** - proactively plan for bridge period

#### **What to Tell Your Patient**

**For LOW RISK patients**:
> "Great news - since you're already on oral PrEP, we can switch you to the injection very soon. I'll order an HIV test today, and if it's negative, we can give you your first injection within a week. The injection will last 2 months [or 6 months for lenacapavir], so you won't need to take daily pills anymore."

**For HIGH RISK patients**:
> "I want to make sure you successfully get started on the injection. I'm going to connect you with [Navigator Name], who will help coordinate your appointments, HIV testing, and the injection. They'll also help with [transportation/childcare/etc.]. They'll call you within 24 hours. This is really important - lots of people want the injection but face challenges getting started, and that's exactly what [Navigator] helps with."

**For VERY HIGH RISK patients**:
> "I think the injection would work really well for you, but our traditional clinic setup isn't ideal. Let me connect you with [SSP/mobile clinic/peer navigator] who can bring the services to you at [familiar location]. They understand the challenges you're facing and can work around them."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Do I need to know how to code to use this?"

**No!** This guide provides all the information you need without touching code. You can:
- Use the reference tables to quickly assess risk
- Follow the decision trees for intervention selection
- Apply the principles in your clinical practice

If your organization wants to implement the actual computer tool, your IT department can help set it up.

### "How accurate is this tool?"

The tool is based on published data from:
- **Over 15,000 participants** in clinical trials (HPTN 083, 084, PURPOSE-1, PURPOSE-2)
- **Real-world implementation studies** (CAN Community Health Network Study)
- **Systematic reviews** of patient navigation in healthcare

Predictions are **population-level estimates** - individual patients may vary, but the tool provides scientifically-grounded guidance.

### "What if my patient doesn't fit neatly into one category?"

Use your clinical judgment to select the **closest match**. For example:
- A 25-year-old MSM could be categorized as either "MSM" or "Adolescent" - choose based on which barriers seem most relevant
- A transgender man who has sex with men might be best categorized as "MSM" for risk prediction purposes

The barriers list is more important than perfect category matching.

### "Can I use this tool for lenacapavir AND cabotegravir?"

**Yes!** The bridge period challenges apply to both formulations. The main differences:
- Lenacapavir: Every 6 months (fewer appointments)
- Cabotegravir: Every 2 months (more frequent)
- Lenacapavir is subcutaneous (under skin), cabotegravir is intramuscular (into muscle)

The tool's predictions apply to both.

### "What about once-yearly lenacapavir?"

Once-yearly formulations are currently in Phase 3 trials (expected results second half of 2025). When approved, the bridge period will likely be:
- **Longer** (more conservative testing needed due to year-long exposure)
- **More crucial** (missing one injection = entire year without protection)

The tool's principles will apply, but specific numbers may need updating.

### "How do I know if interventions are working?"

**Track these metrics**:
1. **Initiation Rate**: % of prescriptions resulting in first injection
2. **Bridge Duration**: Days from prescription to injection
3. **Attrition Reasons**: Why did patients not initiate? (insurance? transportation? lost to follow-up?)
4. **Population-Specific Rates**: Are outcomes equitable across groups?

**Target benchmarks**:
- Overall initiation rate: >70% (currently only 53% nationally)
- Bridge duration: <14 days for oral-to-injectable, <28 days for PrEP-naive
- Attrition due to system barriers (insurance, scheduling): <10%

### "This seems like a lot of work. Is it worth it?"

Consider:
- **Current situation**: 47% of patients never get their first injection - that's a complete prevention failure
- **LAI-PrEP advantages**: Once initiated, 81-83% stay on LAI-PrEP (vs. only 52% on oral PrEP)
- **Math**: Investing in successful initiation means you DON'T have to invest in ongoing retention support

**It's actually LESS work overall** to get people started on LAI-PrEP successfully than to support ongoing oral PrEP adherence.

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### 🎯 **The Core Problem**
Only 53% of patients prescribed LAI-PrEP actually get their first injection. The bridge period is where we lose people.

### 🎯 **The Core Solution**
Proactively identify high-risk patients and implement evidence-based interventions **before** they get lost.

### 🎯 **The Biggest Win**
Patients already on oral PrEP have 85-90% success with transitions. **Prioritize them!**

### 🎯 **The Equity Imperative**
Without intentional intervention, populations most likely to benefit (adolescents, women, PWID) will have the lowest access. This is a **health equity issue**.

### 🎯 **The Evidence Base**
This isn't guesswork - it's based on data from over 15,000 clinical trial participants and real-world implementation studies.

---

**Remember**: LAI-PrEP is clinically extraordinary (>96% efficacy, 81-83% persistence). The challenge isn't the medication - it's the bridge period. This tool helps you bridge that gap.
