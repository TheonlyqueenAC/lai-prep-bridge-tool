# LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Quick Reference Card
## One-Page Clinical Decision Guide

---

## üö® THE PROBLEM: 47% of prescribed patients never get their first injection

---

## STEP 1: ASSESS RISK (30 seconds)

### Is patient currently on oral PrEP?
- ‚úÖ **YES** ‚Üí SUCCESS RATE: 85-90% | **ACTION: Priority for rapid transition**
- ‚ùå **NO** ‚Üí Continue to population assessment

### Population Category
| Population | Success Rate | Risk Level |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| MSM | 55% | Moderate |
| Women | 45% | Moderate-High |
| Transgender women | 50% | Moderate |
| **Adolescents (16-24)** | **35%** | **HIGH** |
| **PWID** | **25%** | **VERY HIGH** |

### Count Barriers (check all that apply)
‚òê Transportation  
‚òê Childcare  
‚òê Housing unstable  
‚òê Insurance delays  
‚òê Medical mistrust  
‚òê Privacy concerns  
‚òê Legal concerns  
‚òê No ID  

**Subtract 10% for each barrier** from baseline rate

---

## STEP 2: SELECT INTERVENTIONS

### üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY (Do First)

**If on oral PrEP + recent HIV test (<7 days):**
‚Üí **SAME-DAY SWITCHING** (+40 points)  
‚úì Can inject today or within 3 days  
‚úì Eliminates bridge period entirely

**If on oral PrEP (no recent test):**
‚Üí **RAPID ORAL-TO-INJECTABLE TRANSITION** (+35 points)  
‚úì Schedule HIV test + injection for same week  
‚úì 85-90% success vs. 53% for new patients

**If PWID:**
‚Üí **HARM REDUCTION INTEGRATION** (+15 points)  
‚úì Partner with syringe service program  
‚úì ESSENTIAL - traditional clinic will fail

---

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Implement for At-Risk Patients)

| Intervention | Impact | Best For |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Patient Navigation** | +15 pts | Adolescents, women, anyone <50% success |
| **Peer Navigation** | +12 pts | PWID, transgender, complex barriers |
| **Accelerated Testing** (RNA+Ag/Ab) | +10 pts | All new patients |
| **Transportation Support** | +8 pts | When barrier identified |
| **Childcare Support** | +8 pts | Parents |
| **Expedited Insurance** | +10 pts | When delays expected |

---

### üü¢ MODERATE PRIORITY (Easy Wins)

- Text message reminders: +5 points
- Telehealth counseling: +6 points
- Mobile delivery: +12 points (if available)

---

## STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL SUCCESS RATE

1. Start with baseline (population rate)
2. Subtract barrier impact (10% per barrier)
3. Add top 3 interventions (70% of combined effect)

### Success Rate Interpretation
- **>70%**: Excellent - standard protocols OK
- **50-69%**: Good - navigation recommended
- **30-49%**: Concerning - multiple interventions needed
- **<30%**: Critical - intensive support required

---

## STEP 4: IMPLEMENT & TRACK

### What to Do NOW (at prescription visit):
1. ‚òê Assign navigator (if high risk)
2. ‚òê Order HIV test (expedited processing)
3. ‚òê Provide transportation voucher (if needed)
4. ‚òê Schedule injection appointment
5. ‚òê Submit insurance authorization
6. ‚òê Set up text reminders
7. ‚òê Document barriers in chart

### Follow-Up Timeline:
- **24 hours**: Navigator contacts patient
- **48 hours**: Text reminder before HIV test
- **7-14 days**: Target for first injection (oral PrEP transitions)
- **14-28 days**: Target for first injection (new patients)

---

## üìä QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Patient Type | First Action | Expected Success |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Oral PrEP + recent test** | Same-day inject | 90% |
| **Oral PrEP (any)** | Rapid transition | 85-90% |
| **New MSM, minimal barriers** | Standard protocol + navigation | 60-70% |
| **New woman, 2-3 barriers** | Navigation + barrier support | 50-60% |
| **Adolescent, multiple barriers** | Intensive navigation + all supports | 30-45% |
| **PWID, traditional clinic** | **WILL FAIL** - refer to SSP | <10% |
| **PWID, harm reduction integrated** | SSP delivery + peer navigator | 30-40% |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS (System Failure Likely)

**Don't just prescribe if you see:**
- ‚ùå PWID without harm reduction partnership
- ‚ùå Adolescent without navigation support
- ‚ùå Multiple barriers without intervention plan
- ‚ùå Insurance issues without expedited process

**These patients will NOT initiate without proactive intervention!**

---

## üí° WHAT TO TELL YOUR PATIENT

### ‚úÖ For HIGH SUCCESS patients (oral PrEP):
*"Great news! Since you're already on the pill, we can switch you to the injection quickly. Let's get you an HIV test this week and schedule your first injection."*

### ‚ö†Ô∏è For MODERATE RISK patients:
*"I'm connecting you with [Name], our PrEP navigator. They'll help coordinate your HIV test, injection appointment, and [transportation/childcare]. They'll call you within 24 hours. This is important - we want to make sure you successfully get started."*

### üö® For HIGH RISK patients:
*"I want to make sure this works for you. Traditional clinic visits can be challenging, so I'm connecting you with [SSP/mobile clinic/peer navigator] who can bring services to you. They understand the barriers you're facing."*

---

## üìà TRACK YOUR PROGRAM

### Essential Metrics:
1. **Initiation rate**: # injections √∑ # prescriptions
2. **Bridge duration**: Days from prescription to injection
3. **Attrition reasons**: Why didn't they start?

### Target Benchmarks:
- **Overall initiation**: >70% (US average is only 53%)
- **Oral-to-injectable**: >85%
- **Bridge duration**: <14 days (oral PrEP), <28 days (new patients)

---

## üéØ KEY TAKEAWAY

**The bridge period is where we lose patients.**  
**Proactive intervention prevents attrition.**  
**Oral PrEP patients are your easiest wins - prioritize them!**

---

## Evidence Base

Based on:
- HPTN 083 (4,566 MSM), HPTN 084 (3,224 women)
- PURPOSE-1 (5,338 women), PURPOSE-2 (2,183 diverse)
- CAN Community Health Network (real-world: 53% initiation)
- Trio Health (81-83% persistence once initiated)

**LAI-PrEP works brilliantly once started - we just need to get people started!**
