# Security Policy

## Overview

The LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Decision Support Tool handles sensitive healthcare information related to HIV prevention. We take security and patient privacy extremely seriously.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Principles

### 1. **No PHI Storage**
This tool does NOT store Protected Health Information (PHI). All processing happens locally on the user's system.

### 2. **Local Processing**
Patient assessments are performed entirely on the local machine. No data is transmitted to external servers.

### 3. **Open Source**
All code is open source and auditable for security review.

### 4. **HIPAA-Compliant by Design**
Tool architecture prevents accidental PHI exposure or storage.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### **DO NOT** Report Security Vulnerabilities Publicly

Security vulnerabilities should **NEVER** be reported through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### How to Report

**Email:** security@nyxdynamics.org

**PGP Key:** [Available on request]

### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Potential PHI Exposure in Patient Export

Description:
The patient export function may inadvertently include 
identifiable information in the JSON output under certain 
conditions.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create patient profile with specific demographics
2. Export using export_patient() function
3. Check JSON output for identifiable fields

Impact:
Potential HIPAA violation through accidental PHI exposure

Affected Versions:
1.0.0, 1.0.1

Suggested Fix:
Add PHI scrubbing to export function before serialization

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Healthcare Providers

1. **Environment Security**
   - Use tool only on secure, HIPAA-compliant systems
   - Ensure workstation encryption is enabled
   - Keep system and antivirus software updated
   - Lock workstation when leaving

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit tool access to authorized personnel only
   - Use strong authentication for system access
   - Follow organizational access policies
   - Log and monitor tool usage

3. **Data Handling**
   - Never include PHI in bug reports or issues
   - De-identify any data used for testing
   - Follow organizational data retention policies
   - Securely dispose of any printed materials

4. **Network Security**
   - Use tool on secure, private networks only
   - Avoid public Wi-Fi for patient assessments
   - Use VPN if remote access is required
   - Follow organizational network policies

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Review all code for potential PHI leakage
   - Never hardcode sensitive information
   - Use parameterized queries (if database added)
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize all outputs

2. **Testing**
   - Use only synthetic/de-identified test data
   - Never use real patient information for testing
   - Include security tests in test suite
   - Test all user input validation

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security advisories for dependencies
   - Use `pip-audit` or similar tools
   - Pin dependency versions

4. **PHI Protection**
   - Never commit PHI to repository
   - Review all commits before pushing
   - Use `.gitignore` for sensitive directories
   - Enable pre-commit hooks

## HIPAA Compliance

### Privacy Requirements

This tool is designed to support HIPAA-compliant workflows:

✅ **Minimum Necessary:** Tool only requests essential data
✅ **Local Processing:** No PHI transmitted externally
✅ **No Storage:** No PHI persisted to disk
✅ **Audit Trail:** Organizations can log usage per their policies
✅ **Access Controls:** Deployable with organizational controls

### User Responsibilities

Users are responsible for:

- Deploying tool in HIPAA-compliant environment
- Implementing appropriate access controls
- Maintaining audit logs per organizational policy
- Training staff on secure usage
- Ensuring proper device security
- Following data breach notification procedures

### What This Tool Does NOT Do

❌ Does NOT store patient data
❌ Does NOT transmit data to external servers
❌ Does NOT create a covered entity relationship
❌ Does NOT require a Business Associate Agreement
❌ Does NOT include audit logging (user's responsibility)

## Known Limitations

### Current Version (1.0.0)

1. **No Built-in Encryption**
   - User responsible for device encryption
   - No file-level encryption of tool outputs

2. **No Audit Logging**
   - Organizations must implement their own logging
   - Tool does not track who used it or when

3. **No Access Controls**
   - Tool itself has no authentication
   - Relies on system-level access controls

4. **No Data Loss Prevention**
   - Users can export data (by design for flexibility)
   - No automatic PHI detection or blocking

These are intentional design choices to keep the tool lightweight and locally-deployable. Organizations should layer their own security controls as needed.
