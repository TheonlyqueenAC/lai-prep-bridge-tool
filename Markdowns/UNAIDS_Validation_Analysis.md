## 1. Regional Analysis: Global Health Equity

### Regional Success Rates (Ranked)

| Region | N (millions) | Baseline Success | With Interventions | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Europe/Central Asia** | 1.27 | 29.33% | 48.34% | +19.01 pts |
| **North America** | 3.82 | 29.32% | 48.33% | +19.01 pts |
| **Asia/Pacific** | 1.06 | 24.78% | 44.24% | +19.45 pts |
| **Latin America/Caribbean** | 1.91 | 24.78% | 44.23% | +19.45 pts |
| **Sub-Saharan Africa** | 13.14 | 21.69% | 41.46% | +19.76 pts |

### Critical Finding: Regional Health Equity Gap

**7.64 percentage point disparity** between highest and lowest performing regions

- **Highest:** Europe/Central Asia (29.33%)
- **Lowest:** Sub-Saharan Africa (21.69%)
- **Relative disparity:** Sub-Saharan Africa faces 35% lower baseline success

**Policy Implication:** Resource allocation must prioritize Sub-Saharan Africa, which represents:
- 62% of global PrEP users (13.14 million)
- Lowest baseline success rates
- Greatest potential for intervention impact (+19.76 points)

## 2. Population-Specific Outcomes: Vulnerable Groups

### Success Rates by Priority Population

| Population | N (millions) | Baseline | Final Rate | Improvement |
|------------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **MSM** | 3.03 | 33.11% | 48.45% | +15.35 pts |
| **General Population** | 3.03 | 31.22% | 46.57% | +15.35 pts |
| **Transgender Women** | 3.03 | 28.46% | 43.83% | +15.36 pts |
| **Cisgender Women** | 3.03 | 24.10% | 48.06% | +23.96 pts |
| **Pregnant/Lactating** | 3.03 | 24.11% | 39.45% | +15.33 pts |
| **Adolescents (16-24)** | 3.03 | 16.34% | 40.30% | +23.96 pts |
| **People Who Inject Drugs** | 3.03 | 10.36% | 37.82% | +27.46 pts |

### Critical Health Equity Findings

#### 1. **Population Disparity: 22.75 Percentage Points**
- **Highest:** MSM at 33.11% baseline
- **Lowest:** PWID at 10.36% baseline
- **Relative disadvantage:** PWID face 3.2x lower success rates

#### 2. **Greatest Intervention Impact**
Populations benefiting most from targeted interventions:
1. **PWID:** +27.46 points (265% relative improvement)
2. **Adolescents:** +23.96 points (147% relative improvement)
3. **Cisgender Women:** +23.96 points (99% relative improvement)

#### 3. **Health Equity Success**
With interventions, the gap narrows:
- PWID rise from 10.36% → 37.82%
- Adolescents rise from 16.34% → 40.30%
- **Remaining gaps require systemic barrier removal**

## 3. Barrier Analysis: The Foundation of Health Inequity

### Impact of Cumulative Barriers

| Barriers | N (millions) | Success Rate | Decline per Barrier |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **0** | 3.03 | 43.996% | Baseline |
| **1** | 4.90 | 33.614% | -10.38 pts |
| **2** | 5.30 | 23.497% | -10.25 pts |
| **3** | 3.77 | 14.794% | -9.73 pts |
| **4** | 2.63 | 8.098% | -8.97 pts |
| **5** | 1.57 | 5.281% | -7.74 pts |

### Critical Insights

1. **Barrier Distribution:**
   - 85.7% of patients face at least one barrier
   - 42.6% face 3+ barriers (high/very high attrition risk)
   
2. **Per-Barrier Impact:**
   - Average: **-7.74 percentage points per barrier**
   - Most severe: First barrier (-10.38 points)
   - Cumulative: 5 barriers reduce success by **88% relative to baseline**

3. **Global Implication:**
   - **18.2 million patients** (85.7%) face barriers
   - Removing barriers could improve outcomes for entire cohort
   - Priority interventions must address structural barriers

---

## 4. Risk Stratification: Predictive Precision

### Attrition Risk Distribution

| Risk Level | N (millions) | Percentage | Clinical Action |
|------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Low** | 0 | 0.00% | Minimal support needed |
| **Moderate** | 1.73 | 8.15% | Standard care adequate |
| **High** | 5.62 | 26.53% | Enhanced interventions |
| **Very High** | 13.85 | 65.32% | Intensive support required |

### Critical Finding

**65.32% of patients at very high attrition risk** - representing 13.85 million individuals globally

**Policy Implication:** 
- Default approach must assume high-intensity support needs
- Resource allocation should prioritize "very high risk" as standard
- Only 8.15% can succeed with minimal intervention
